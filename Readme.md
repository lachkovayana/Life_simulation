<h3>About the project: </h3>

_Goal_: learning object-oriented programming


Entities:

 <h4> People</h4>

Men and women form a couple if they are healthy and not hungry. After that, the man finds a place to build a new house (perhaps joining an existing village consisting of several nearby houses). In the house, a woman can give birth to children.

Each person in the village has a role: builder / hunter / gatherer and others.

If a person is not hungry, he can collect food in reserve and store it in a personal storage or take it to a barn (personal or belonging to the village)

<h4> Seasons</h4>

Every N ticks of the timer, the color of the field changes - green means summer, white means winter


<h4> Animals </h4>

They are divided into herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. After death, they turn into meat that can be harvested by people or eaten by animals.

Some animals hibernate in winter.

Some animals can be tamed. Then they can help the owners with their skills and come to them for food when they get hungry.


<h4> Plants </h4>

It goes through four stages: seed, sprout, grown plant and dead plant.

They are divided into poisonous and healthy, edible and inedible.

Poisonous ones take health indicators faster from those who eat them. Some plants die in winter.
